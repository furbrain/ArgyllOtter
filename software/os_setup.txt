System set up notes:
Needs approxeng.input as per lorraine's blog
Need to install servoblaster, this needs to be set as PCM to avoid interfering
with neopixels.
Set to 1us output resolution, set output 0 only
Need to install jgarffs neopixel python lib - which needs to be installed from source as seems to be using an old version of main lib
Install simple-pid python thingy - needs to be installed from github as not on raspbian currently (not currently used...)
