each state is actually a task

we have a Load state - this gets a ball lodged in the mouth of the barrel, 
and then returns the barrel to the current aim angle

Load state:
   Pump off 
   Drop barrel to -15 degrees
   Pump on
   if pressure increases above limit:
      pump off
      Set angle to preset state
      
   if more than 2s elapsed
      pump off
      raise barrel to +20 degrees
      wait 1 s
      return to start

Aim state: pump is off.
   If pressure is below lower limit, turn pump on until above limit
   If pressure is very low we have lost the ball - return to Load state
   
Fire state:
   save current angle
   Adjust aim via calibration
   Pump on, wait until pump pressure properly low
   Go to Load state ?possibly count number of shots and go to reload state
   
Reload state:
    Pump off
    Laser off
