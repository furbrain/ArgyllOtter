Software organisation options

Have separate functions which are called for each mode
    Pros: Simple
    Cons: Changes in controller etc need to be duplicated - violates DRY
    
Have classes for each mode which are polled at frequent intervals
    Pros: Can abstract out controller mechanism
        : Allows manager code to abort if needed
    
    Cons: More complex
          How de we handle the case where we are doing complex CV stuff and over-run
          our time slot? Maybe do the complex stuff in separate slot and poll for completion?
          
Solution:
    Total asynchronous scheme
         use asyncio
         means "main function" can keep an eye on voltage, check for home signals etc
         really quite complex
