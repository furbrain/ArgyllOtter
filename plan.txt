Plan:
Motors with encoders
Separate board to control motors, communicate via I2C with pi
interface:
	Set speed
	Set distance
	Possibly just set X,Y coordinates to visit next
	Set rotation angle
	
	
PiCamera with computer visiony type stuff

Use a laser range finder also

Have suspension which can be enabled or disabled

Use home made chassis

Cannon - use miniature ping-pong balls, use pvc pipe for a barrel
Use atomic power popper and a pump to fire it.
Servo to change angle

Maze - use computer vision to identify faces and orient correctly.
	 - use laser range finder to get distance to them - then drive correct
       distance and use the stored list of turns to 
       
Similar approach for nebula...       
       
Use bluetooth and games controller to communicate??
