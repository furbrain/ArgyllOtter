I2C protocol:
Write:
Byte 0: ACTION flag - when set, copy the rest of the write code..
Bytes 1: 0x00 = STOP
         0x01 = Direct Drive
         0x02 = Location
         0x03 = Rotate
         0x04 = Individual Motors
         0xFF = Calibrate
        
Direct Drive:
Byte 2-3: Left wheel speed (signed int16_t) (max is +0x3ff, min is -0x3ff)
Byte 3-4: Right wheel speed (signed int16_t) 

Location:
Byte 2-5: Distance for left wheels to travel in mm (signed int32_t)
Byte 6-9: Distance for right wheels to travel in mm (signed int32_t)
Byte 10-11: Max Speed (uint16_t) (but max is 127)

Rotate:
Byte 2-3: Angle to rotate by in degrees (signed int16_t)

Individual
Byte 2-3: Front Right speed
Byte 4-5: Front Left speed
Byte 6-7: Rear Right speed
Byte 8-9: Rear Left speed

Calbrate:
Start calibration sequence

Read:
0x00 - 0x0F New command
0x10 - 0x1F Current command
0x20 - 0x27 Velocity in mm/s (signed int16_t) (per wheel)
0x28 - 0x2F Distance in mm (signed int32_t) (per side)
0x30 - 0x37 Cell voltage in mV (signed int16_t) (per cell)
